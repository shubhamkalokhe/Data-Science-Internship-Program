# Data Science Projects Repository

Welcome to my Data Science Projects Repository! This repository contains a collection of data science projects completed during my internship program with CoachX. Each project focuses on different aspects of data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Absenteeism Project

The Absenteeism Project explores patterns of absenteeism in a workplace setting. It involves analyzing factors contributing to employee absenteeism, such as reasons for absence, time of absence, and related demographic information. Predictive models are built to forecast absenteeism and identify key drivers.

### 2. Email Spam Classification Project

The Email Spam Classification Project focuses on classifying emails as spam or non-spam. It involves preprocessing email data, extracting relevant features, and training machine learning models to classify incoming emails. Various classification algorithms are explored to improve the accuracy of spam detection.

### 3. AdaBoost Performance Analysis

The AdaBoost Performance Analysis project evaluates the performance of the AdaBoost algorithm on a classification task. It includes experimenting with different base learners, tuning hyperparameters, and assessing the impact of boosting iterations on model performance. Visualizations and metrics are used to analyze and interpret the results.

### 4. House Price Prediction Project

The House Price Prediction Project aims to predict house prices using machine learning techniques. It utilizes the dataset from the "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques" competition on Kaggle. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to develop accurate predictive models for estimating house prices.

## Repository Structure

- Each project is organized into its own directory within the repository.
- The directories contain Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts, along with any associated data files or resources.
- Detailed README files are provided within each project directory, providing a comprehensive overview of the project objectives, methodologies, and results.

## Usage

To explore the projects:

1. Navigate to the respective project directory of interest.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script associated with the project.
3. Follow the instructions provided within the project documentation to execute the code, analyze the results, and replicate the findings.

## Requirements

The projects are implemented using Python and require the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- xgboost

These dependencies can be installed via pip using the command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
